# Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM
Introduction and Libraries Setup:

The notebook begins with a markdown cell introducing the project title.
It proceeds to import essential libraries including TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning, Pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for data visualization.
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The project uses pandas_datareader to fetch historical stock price data from financial APIs.
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalizing data for better performance of the LSTM model, and creating sequences of data points for time series prediction.
Model Development:

The core of the project involves developing a Stacked LSTM model. LSTMs are chosen for their capability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them suitable for stock price prediction.
The model architecture is defined using Keras Sequential API, with multiple LSTM layers stacked together to improve learning capability.
The model is compiled with appropriate loss functions and optimizers, and then trained on the prepared dataset.
Model Evaluation and Prediction:

Post-training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualization techniques.
The model is used to make future stock price predictions, and the results are plotted to visualize the predicted versus actual prices.
Conclusion and Future Work:

The notebook concludes with a summary of the results and potential areas for further improvement, such as experimenting with different model architectures or incorporating additional data features for enhanced accuracy.
